## How It Works

**Memories** are individual pieces of knowledge that persist across sessions. Facts, insights, decisions, corrections, and context from your conversations.

**Relationships** connect memories into a knowledge graph. Link related ideas, build evidence chains, and create a web of understanding that search can traverse.

**Documents** you upload get chunked and embedded for search. Each chunk becomes searchable alongside your memories.

**Hybrid Search** combines BM25 keyword matching, vector similarity, and graph expansion to find relevant memories even when your query doesn't match exact words.

## API Reference
